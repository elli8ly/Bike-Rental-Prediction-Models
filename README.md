# Bike-Rental-Predection-Models
In this project, I developed a predictive model for bike rentals by exploring a variety of machine learning techniques. The goal was to forecast the number of bike rentals based on historical usage data along with factors such as weather conditions, time of day, and seasonal trends.

Key Techniques Used:

KKN (K-Nearest Neighbors): Captured local patterns in the data by comparing rental instances with similar features.

Linear Regression: Served as a baseline model to understand linear relationships between bike rentals and independent variables.

Boosted Trees: Leveraged gradient boosting to sequentially improve prediction accuracy by correcting errors made by previous models.

Random Forest: Employed an ensemble of decision trees to enhance robustness and generalization through averaging multiple predictions.

Project Workflow:

Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering: Cleaned the dataset, handled missing values, and created recipe with relevant features from bike rental data.

Model Training & Evaluation: Trained each model using cross-validation and evaluated performance using metrics such as RMSE and RÂ².

Insights & Comparisons: Analyzed the impact of different variables on bike rentals and compared the effectiveness of traditional regression against ensemble methods.

This multi-model approach not only highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each method but also provides a comprehensive framework for forecasting bike rental demand and deriving actionable insights for bike-sharing systems.
